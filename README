- fixes bug in 'def _date_for_yearmonth(self, ym):' method (ref. issue #2 https://github.com/erdavila/Recurrence/issues/2 )
- adds year recurrence capability (ref. issue #1 https://github.com/erdavila/Recurrence/issues/1 )

A month recur object can now recur on any day in a period.

Still to do the algorithm does not accommodate, e.g., the first Mon in the first full week of the month (could be implemented relatively easily).

There already exists a fully implemented recur rule library by the name of python-dateutil http://labix.org/python-dateutil which implements rrule (and which has also has a Javascript port https://github.com/jkbr/rrule).   Eduardo D'Avila's approach though does have its merits.
